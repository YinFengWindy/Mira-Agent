 * release glide, eased moves) and knows nothing about speech bubbles. The
 * plugin measures its own bubble, asks the host for nothing but the work area
 * it was clamped into, and then requests a surface extension.
 *
 * Ported from the former main-process `resolveDesktopPetBubbleLayout`; the
 * tie-breaking is deliberately unchanged so a bubble does not start flipping
 * sides at positions where it used to stay put.

/**
 * Turns a `plugin.desktop_pet.binding.get` response into a binding, or `null`.
 *
 * `null` covers every "nothing to show" case in one answer — no pet-enabled
 * role, no selected package, a package whose spritesheet the host would not
 * grant — because the only caller does the same thing for all of them: hide
 * the pet. Before #181-C this parsing sat in `main.ts` and read the core
 * `roles.list` payload directly; it now reads the plugin's own RPC, which is
 * the only bridge namespace background code can reach.
 *
 * `resolveAssetUrl` is `ctx.assets.url`. A granted path becomes an opaque
 * `shiori-asset://` URL; an ungranted one is `null`, and is treated as no
 * binding at all rather than as a pet with a broken image.
